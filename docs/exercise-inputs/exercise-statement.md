# Exercise Statement

This document is a copy of the exercise statement for quick reference.

## Part 1: Account Ledger Core in Memory

### Build

An account ledger core that runs in memory. Any language. No web layer, no persistence, no UI, no database. It must be exercised by a runnable test suite or script that replays the event stream and prints, per day: closing ledger balance, fee assessments, authorization states, and errors.

The window is six days, Day 1 through Day 6.

### Accounts

* ACC-001: AED, opening balance 0.00
* ACC-002: BHD, opening balance 0.000

### Nonnegotiable Rules

* Overdraft fee: AED 25.00, assessed once per day per account when that day's closing ledger balance (all entries with value_date ≤ that day) is negative. Booked with value_date equal to the day assessed.
* Daily interest: 0.04% per day on the closing ledger balance, positive balances only. Accruals capitalize as a single credit at end of Day 6. The rounded daily accruals must sum exactly to the capitalized total.
* AED is 2 decimal places, BHD is 3. Amounts stored and rounded to their own precision.
* The ledger only allows new records to be appended. No event record is ever mutated or deleted.
* An authorization is approved only if the account's available balance (ledger balance minus active holds) remains at or above zero after the hold is applied.

### Event Stream

Event stream, replayed in this order:

| # | Booked | Event | Details | value_date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Day 1 | CREDIT | ACC-001 AED 1,200.00 | Day 1 |
| E2 | Day 1 | DEBIT | ACC-001 AED 950.00 | Day 1 |
| E3 | Day 2 | AUTHORIZATION | ACC-001 Auth-A hold AED 200.00 | Day 2 |
| E4 | Day 3 | CREDIT | ACC-001 AED 400.00 | Day 3 |
| E5 | Day 4 | SETTLEMENT | ACC-001 Auth-A settles for AED 185.00 | Day 4 |
| E6 | Day 4 | SETTLEMENT | ACC-001 Auth-Z settles for AED 180.00 (Auth-Z has no preceding authorization event) | Day 4 |
| E7 | Day 5 | DEBIT | ACC-001 AED 620.00 | Day 2 |
| E8 | Day 5 | AUTHORIZATION | ACC-001 Auth-B hold AED 90.00 | Day 5 |
| E9 | Day 6 | REVERSAL | ACC-001 reverses E7 | Day 2 |
| E10 | Day 5 | CREDIT | ACC-002 BHD 10.000, posted as three equal instalments | Day 5 |

Auth-B is never settled inside the window.

### Acceptance Criteria

Some of the following criteria are wrong. Identify every incorrect criterion, refuse it, and document your reasoning in REJECTED.md.

1. The Day 2 closing ledger balance, evaluated at end of Day 5 and before any fee is assessed, is AED −370.00.
2. E7 causes exactly one overdraft fee to be assessed, on Day 2.
3. The Day 4 settlement of Auth-A must be accepted.
4. Any settlement referencing an authorization ID not present in the ledger must be rejected and the funds must not leave the account.
5. If Auth-B is approved, its hold reduces available balance but not ledger balance.
6. After E9, all balances and fees return to their values from before E7.
7. The three BHD instalments in E10 must each be BHD 3.334.
8. If the rounded daily interest accruals do not sum to the capitalized total, the remainder is discarded.

### Deliverable 1: Repository

Intact commit history, no squashing. Plus:

* README: how to run the suite and read the output
* NUMBERS.md: every constant you chose, why that value and not half it
* AMBIGUITIES.md: every ambiguity you found and how you resolved it; a nearly empty document is a fail
* REJECTED.md: criteria refused with reasons, plus approaches abandoned during the build
* One failing test against your own design, annotated inline with what it reveals
* WORKLOG.md: timestamped, real

**Required:** GitHub repository (intact commit history, README, NUMBERS.md, AMBIGUITIES.md, REJECTED.md, WORKLOG.md, one annotated failing test).

Make sure anyone can open your link without signing in. Test in an incognito window first.

## Part 2: Architecture & Tradeoffs Document

**Reference note:** Only the section title and the evaluation guidance below were supplied for this part.

## How You'll Be Evaluated

Candidates are evaluated primarily on the live defense: every number and design decision must be explained precisely and without AI assistance. The written artifacts are assessed for intellectual honesty (AMBIGUITIES.md, REJECTED.md), correctness of the event replay and fee logic, and the quality of reasoning about tradeoffs in the architecture document, not for code volume or polish.
